Here's the second run, mostly related to the summer project. 

Same 96 Niono coluzzii, same settings, but with 2 changes: 
1) I relax the assumption of having >=20 polymorphic sites. We are unsure about the potential bias on the rho estimates if we cherry-pick the windows with the highest polymorphism. 
Besides, we cannot detect any recombination if there is zero or one polymorphic sites. Therefore having >=2 polymorphic sites is the bare minimum. NA otherwise. 

2) The second improvement is the exhaustive evaluation of all 100bp windows. No more random sampling of windows.
