They are Niono coluzzii samples (mostly females, check), first 96 of them. The raw data include all accessible biallelic sites (missing alleles are permitted). 

I first chop each chromosome arm into 50kb chunks, from which I define 500 non-overlapping 100bp windows. I randomly select some 100bp window from each chunk to run LD-hat. 

Another criteria included is the number of polymorphic (biallelic to be exact) sites within each 100bp window. Only windows with >=20 polymorphic sites are sent to LD-hat. 

The chunks are unimportant as they are for stratified sampling. 

The inputs are unphased genotypes, coded as 0, 1, 2 as per the manual of LD-hat. Missing are coded as question marks (?). The conversion model is assumed. 

I am using the pre-compiled likelihood lookup table with 96 diploids and theta of 0.001. 

Because of the random sampling of 100bp windows within each chunk I do not have control on the total number of windows we ontain from LD-hat. 

But overall 3R has ~40000 windows. 

Some plots can be found in the notebook.
